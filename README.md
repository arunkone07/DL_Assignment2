Implementations for Part A and Part B of the assignment are added in folders partA and partB respectively.
Both folders contain an ipynb file (python notebook) and a python file. 
torch, torchvision, matplotlib, argparse, wandb and few other modules imported in the code are expected to be installed before execution.
Please change the dataset paths in code accordingly.
Also, you need to login to wandb before proceeding.

**python3 partA/train_A.py -h** and **python3 partB/train_B.py -h** are the commands to get help on how to run the python files. Details can be found here too:
